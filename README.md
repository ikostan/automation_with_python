# Automated Software Testing with Python

The most comprehensive course on Automated Software Testing with Python on Udemy.

Testing automation doesn't have to be painful. Software testing is an essential skill for any developer, and I'm here to help you truly understand all types of test automation with Python.

Created by Jose Salvatierra, software engineer and founder of Teclado. The focus of this course is on testing for the web—we'll be working with REST APIs and web applications, and technologies such as unittest, Postman, and Selenium WebDriver.

## What will you work with?

This course is jam packed with all the latest technologies for you to use professionally and in personal projects:

- The unittest library, Python's standard automated software testing library;
- Mocking and patching, two essential tools to reduce dependencies when testing;
- unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing—all types of testing to have you fully covered;
- Postman for easy collaboration and testing while developing;
- Selenium WebDriver for automated browser tests;
- Git and Travis for continuous integration of your project.
